This [competition](http://www.codetown.us/group/contesttown/forum/topics/wari-contest-1) was announced at noon on December 27, 2009, and contestants had until midnight to create a Wari program. 

Since I won the competition, Michael Levin has asked me to discuss my code at the next [GatorJUG meeting](http://www.codetown.us/events/gatorjug-on-iphone) on January 13.

You can try out the game server on [my website](http://ericlavigne.net:8054).
